/* A UUID is defined by RFC-4122 as a 128-bit identifier with the two most
 * significant bits of the ninth byte being 1 and 0, which indicates the
 * "variant" that is described by the RFC.  Other variants exist, but are not
 * supported here, and are treated as INVALID by the functions defined below.
 * Any attempt to pass an invalid UUID to a function that requires a valid UUID
 * as input will probably result in the calling process being aborted (see
 * SIGABRT, abort(3)).
 *
 * In a valid UUID, the four lowest significant bits of the seventh byte define
 * the "version" of the UUID, which essentially indicates how it was generated.
 * The RFC defines five SUPPORTED versions.  Any other version is UNSUPPORTED.
 *
 * The fields in the UUID 'record' structure are stored in network byte order,
 * so code wishing to make use of the record structure must use ntohl(3) and
 * ntohs(3) to read values, and htonl(3) and htons(3) to assign values.
 *
 * OS-X already defines a "uuid_t" typedef and has a "uuid_generate_random()"
 * function, so all symbols defined in this file are prefixed with
 * serval_uuid_ to avoid potential collisions on OS-X and other platforms.
